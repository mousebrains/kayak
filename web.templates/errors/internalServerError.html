<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
<div class="message">
  <p>I'm terribly sorry, but I messed up.</p>
  <p>Believe me, I tried and tried, but every now and then I have to fart.</p>
  <p>You can't even imagine the millions of calculations I had to go thru to 
     try and and do what you asked for, but one of them farted. So don't blame it on
     me, it was the farting instruction!</p>
  <p>No, it's not your fault, it's all my own.  I'm a bad server.  I know.  Terrible.
  I should get a new job one day or another, but what else can I do?</p>
